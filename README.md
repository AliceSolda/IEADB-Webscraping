Web scraping and the IEA Database

(c) Ronald B. Mitchell and the IEA Database Project, 2002-2020

The IEA Database currently contains over 1,300 MEAs, over 2,200 BEAs, 250 other envi-ronmental agreements, 
and over 90,000 individual country “membership actions” that are constantly being revised and updated.

This repository contains a series of web scraping tutorials (alongside with the code) 
specifically design to retrieve data (e.g. treaties texts, membership data, etc.)
from the IEA Database using Python (tutorials were made using Python 3.7.3).

If you found the tutorials useful, you can thank me by leaving a star to the repository /(^w^)/

Good luck!
