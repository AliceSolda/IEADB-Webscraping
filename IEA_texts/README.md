Tutorial #1: Web scraping treaties from the IEA Database

This folder contains a tutorial that shows you how to web scrap treaties text from the IEA Database using Python (alongside with the full code).

The two python files give two different types of output:

The file IEADB_treaties_text.py gives you unformated documents that contain the treaties text only.

This type of output is perfect if you later plan to use automated text analyses.

The file IEADB_full_page_treaties_text.py gives you documents that contain the full HTML page of the treaty text page. It also keeps the style of the pages, producing nicer documents.

This type of output is better if you later plan to read through the text manually.
